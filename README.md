## About Me
I'm an incoming computer science graduate student at Georgia Tech pivoting from a previous career in civil engineering. I have a passion for technology and have focused my independent studies on frontend development since making the leap into software engineering. I am currently sharpening my skills with React.js, TypeScript, Redux, and CSS as I continue to look for my first frontend engineering role in the industry!
