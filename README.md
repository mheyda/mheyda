# Hi! I’m Marshall Heyda.

### I'm a recent civil engineering graduate who fell in love with coding while completing CS50 and decided to make the transition into software development. 

<p>Currently I'm working through CS50w (the web development sequel course to CS50) and building out my portfolio with personal projects.</br>
My learning right now is focused around Python and JavaScript.</p>
