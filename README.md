# Hi! I’m Marshall Heyda.

In May 2021 I graduated Summa Cum Laude with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering and planned to attend Stanford University for my master's in structural engineering. That all changed, however, the following summer when I fell in love with coding while taking Harvard's CS50 for fun. I decided to dive head first into the world of software development by foregoing grad school (at least for structural engineering), quitting my structural engineering job, and start self-teaching full-time to become a software developer.
<br />
<br />
Since starting my coding journey in August 2021, I have completed multiple online courses including:
<ul>
  <li>CS50 from Harvard University</li>
  <li>"Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming with Java" from Georgia Tech Professional Education</li>
  <li>"Data Structures & Algorithms" from Georgia Tech Professional Education</li>
</ul>

And I'm currently working on:
<ul>
  <li>CS50w (the web development sequel course to CS50)</li>
  <li>Building an ecommerce site for my photography portfolio/store using Django (photography is one of my favorite hobbies)</li>
</ul>
